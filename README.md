# build-books

A small collection of Markdown “build books” and design notes.

Build books are meant to be practical, end-to-end writeups that capture **how to build/operate something** (including tradeoffs, gotchas, and runbooks). Design notes capture **ideas, patterns, and experiments** that may later become build books.

## Contents

- [Orchestrating DAGs with GitLab CI](Orchestrating_DAGs_with_GitLab_CI.md)
- [Plugin-Based Dynamic Dispatch](Plugin-Based_Dynamic_Dispatch.md)

## Conventions

- Write in Markdown (`.md`).
- Prefer descriptive filenames in `Title_Case_With_Underscores.md`.
- Start each document with a short overview and a “Why/When to use this” section.
- Keep examples runnable where possible (commands, config snippets, or minimal code).

## Contributing

PRs welcome. If you add a new document, please also add it to the **Contents** list above.
